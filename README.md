# Diabetes Risk Prediction Notebook
### With Various Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

I have used the [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) Machine Learning Repository and the dataset used is **Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction Dataset** which can be downloaded from [HERE](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset.)

## Algorithms Implemented
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)
- [Decision Tree Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html)
- [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
- [Support Vector Machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html)
- [Gradient Boosting Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html)

Models were trained on different parameters for a range of parameters and the best model of each algorithm was choosen. They were compared by a bar graph at the end.

## The Dataset
The Dataset used is the **Early Stage Diabetes Prediction Dataset** from [UCI](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). 

It is a **520 Lines** long dataset with **17 Columns**. The first 16 colunms are the _Features_ and the last column is the _Label_ named **"class"**.
